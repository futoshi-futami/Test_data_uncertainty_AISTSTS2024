Code to reproduce numerical experiments in Section 7 and Appendix G in the paper.

Dependencies
- Python 3.7.6
- numpy  1.21.6
- matplotlib 3.5.3

1.) META_RBF_M.py
This code includes the experiments of the meta-learning setting when fixing N and changing M using Gaussian basis functions.


2.) META_RBF_N.py
This code includes the experiments of the meta-learning setting when fixing M and changing N using Gaussian basis functions.

You can change the feature map from Gaussian basis function to polynomial functions by chaning the above codes.
